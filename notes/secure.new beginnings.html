Obviously, I consider myself abundantly capable in some of my skills like public speaking and building products, but there’s a subtle sense of falsehood in my self-confidence for other things— that is, I have confidence in my competency for that which I should not.</p><p id="38ac1016-077f-4b90-8e86-dbb29bf943b8" class="">I’ll stop with the Shakespearean sounding English of that last paragraph, but the point still stands. There are parts of my knowledge critical to my current goals that I’m lacking in. These include: </p><ul id="edfc2254-a4e1-473f-a9ce-fb78175be832" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Knowledge in finance or, more generally, skillful business</li></ul><ul id="0396a7b9-f927-4ffc-a59d-2ab0845f4ae9" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Statistics, probability, abstract/discrete math</li></ul><ul id="35c44462-31ba-4174-a850-5f35ce79d623" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">In a similar realm, competitive programming</li></ul><ul id="553614e6-703b-47f1-ac73-2a5ed121d93e" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Knowledge of politics, religion, history, and philosophy</li></ul><ul id="48716afb-6d9f-4239-8358-73f13889d6d4" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Execution of plans/business tactics</li></ul><ul id="3e0727d6-099e-43f3-b1cd-c4c8dde944ca" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Physical acuity</li></ul><p id="cb2094fa-664c-49ce-8d0f-039de8ba4eed" class="">Unintentionally, I’ve ranked these ideas according to a vague sense of priority. </p><p id="4c761f34-9f31-4275-9035-d62b135fa204" class="">What now? The lack of these “things” have slowly deteriorated my sense of self-confidence. Perhaps that’s too negative of a framing, but in thinking about what occupied my mind and prevented me from prioritizing the “life” part of my life this last semester, each of these thoughts were at the forefront. </p><p id="ade1a88a-34fe-4944-8866-2e1cd78e21af" class="">It’s odd. Voicing these things seems to give me a sense of clarity over what constitutes the cloud over my mind—the idea feels oxymoronic—but, as of now, I believe writing this down is a step in the right direction. </p><p id="e0163411-0030-4727-988c-a84345dfce4d" class="">Writing this down feels true. And perhaps that’s why I’m feeling this dull pain in my heart. I truly feel as though I’m weathering this alone— more accurately, I feel the lack of Nikki by my side more vividly. In a way, I think it’s a good thing. I’m making progress towards understanding my self. But, honestly… it really fucking sucks. Talking to people abates the pain—probably because it keeps my mind occupied—but damn. It really sucks. I’ve been taking it out on my parents… perhaps a bit too much. Anyhow, my writing has devolved slightly into a projection of my inner thoughts, so I’ll cut this train of thought here. </p><p id="333bf26f-9a41-4856-9bcb-4f02d683155d" class="">Another thing I’ve started to question is whether I miss Nikki for, well, Nikki, or if it was just comforting having someone who loved me. I find myself asking myself “what’s the difference” and, as of yet, I don’t have a good answer. I just feel they are different, so they must be.</p><p id="49f3b057-86a7-456b-b6a1-dfa6b9216b86" class="">Now for the fun, yet somewhat daunting, part of fixing myself. Like most of my efforts, I’ve subconsciously started already. For some reason, however, I feel it important to consciously note what my subconscious has begun—maybe I lack the confidence in my self-discipline, and I hope that writing it down will improve it? I’m not sure yet, but I’ll go with what I feel like doing.</p><ul id="4520a116-4ac9-4028-b4d9-cfbf885f1268" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Knowledge in finance/business?

But honestly? Fuck that. I’ve grown sick of my mindset of constantly looking to see if I could be doing more and attempting to do that. I’ve begun noticing a trail of convincing myself I need to do something, doing other things I’ve promised myself I’ll do, feeling annoyed when I’m enjoying myself because I should be doing things I’ve promised myself I’ll do, slowly losing self-discipline and self-respect in everything I want to do because of this failure to accomplish a vague idea I prioritized in a moment of brazen self-confidence. I’ll attempt to formalize this thinking in another note another time, but the foundation of this point stands strong.</p><p id="e4bab4de-61d1-4ee2-aa95-aa923014304b" class="">I’m reaching the limit of being able to coherently type out my thoughts, so I’ll end this note here. Somewhat nerdishly, I’m excited to see how this will look on my website. It’ll be a private note because I’m still lacking confidence in the sound of my thoughts, but if someone guesses the password, there’s nothing I can do about that— honestly, I think that’s kinda cool.</p><p id="60db14db-6e51-48a6-bfa2-816d675a1f00" class="">
